# Braxton M | UCBerkley_Challenge_1 | README

In this challenge, we were tasked with a list of acceptance criteria (featured below this section) that would fix the following issues with the basic HTML and CSS Files:

* Increasing Accessibility standards by adding alt tags for images
* Changing outdated strucutre elements ("div" tags) to a semantic HTML element structure
* Elements follow a logical structure with proper spacing
* Heading Attributes and Title Elements (descriptive title)

The original code featured several "div" tags that cluttered the HTML code. I broke the sections of the code into a few sections to make it easier to follow. These sections are:

* Header Bar / Navigation Menu
* Main Content
* Side Bar
* Footer

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```
